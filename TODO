* Claen up time-local programs including lineshape, dm3pes, and dynamics.

lib/

  * Integrate bath functions and shared variables; 
    maybe using a bath_class wrapper? --- partially done.
  * More parameterizations for the js03art bath. 

src/

  * adding Hren seems to solve problems of incorrect long-time 
    dynamics mostly; however, in some cases the violation of
    positivity still occurs. Maybe: better fit to C(t)?
  * poptrans/site_poptrans involving two states that have energy
    cross-over due to static disorder is unphysical... a warnning 
    message should be given...
